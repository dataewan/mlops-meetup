# Data is going to mess you up

Traditional testing methods don't catch as many bugs as they should.
Because data is always unpleasant.

Testing data through tools like Great Expectations is brilliant.

I want more tools in this space, or improved tools in this space.

Great Expectations tests tend to be too noisy and cause more fatigue than the errors that they catch.

Hypothesis for property based testing is also awesome.

# Testing of results

Evidently AI are one of my favourites that I've come across in the space.

# MLOps breaks machine learning into systems

Machine learning was complex.

Now using these tools like ANN lookups, feature stores, model stores means that it is being more systemised.

Allows you to break this down into system thinking.

# Don't need to be allergic to notebooks

Notebooks are a part of this.

Cross training people so that they know how to use notebooks well, tests.

Use notebooks for what they're good for.
Move stuff out of notebooks when you can.

# I want the business rules engine to be less crap

Wish list

I want this to be less rubbish a name

I want it to be more productive. Usually this will just be a separate python module or a docker image.

# Cross collaboration, make this easier

There are a few places where I would be deploying data scientists to write code in this system.

- Feature engineering and data transformations
- Model development and monitoring
- Composition and testing of queries
